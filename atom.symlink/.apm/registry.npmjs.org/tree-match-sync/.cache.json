I recommend you to always set this field when you don't know how many files may be contained in `directory`.\n\nThe output may be an Array (all went good) or an Object (an error occured).\n\nThe Array contains the matched file names.\n\nThe Object has two fields:\n\n1. `status`: the exit code of `tree`;\n1. `stderr`: the error message.\n\n\nThere's also a function that controls if the `tree` command is installed:\n```javascript\nvar treeMatch = require('tree-match');\n\nif(treeMatch.treeIsInstalled()){\n  // OK, tree is installed, do something!\n}else{\n  // Well, tree isn't installed...\n}\n```\nIt has no arguments and returns `true`/`false`.\n\n## Examples\n```javascript\nvar treeMatch = require('tree-match-sync');\n\nvar tree = treeMatch('./test', '**/*.js');\n\nif(Object.prototype.toString.call(tree) === '[object Object]'){\n  console.error(tree);\n}else{\n  console.log(tree);\n  // => [ 'test.js' ]\n}\n```\n---\n```javascript\nvar treeMatch = require('tree-match-sync');\n\nvar tree = treeMatch('./test', '**/*.js', { maxDepth: 0 });\n\nif(Object.prototype.toString.call(tree) === '[object Object]'){\n  console.error(tree);\n  // => { status: 1, stderr: 'tree: Invalid level, must be greater than 0.\\n' }\n}else{\n  console.log(tree);\n}\n```\n\n\n\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/tree-match-sync\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/tree-match-sync.svg\n[travis-image]: https://api.travis-ci.org/boredz/tree-match-sync.svg\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/boredz/tree-match-sync\n[dependencies-url]: https://david-dm.org/boredz/tree-match-sync/\n[dependencies-image]: https://david-dm.org/boredz/tree-match-sync.svg\n[devDependencies-url]: https://david-dm.org/boredz/tree-match-sync/#info=devDependencies\n[devDependencies-image]: https://david-dm.org/boredz/tree-match-sync/dev-status.svg\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bored","email":"raul.macarie@zoho.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-12-09T14:23:13.959Z","created":"2015-11-16T17:50:39.600Z","0.0.1":"2015-11-16T17:50:39.600Z","0.0.2":"2015-12-09T14:23:13.959Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/boredz/tree-match-sync#readme","keywords":["tree","match","file","glob","sync"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/boredz/tree-match-sync.git"},"author":{"name":"Raul Macarie","email":"raul.macarie@zoho.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/boredz/tree-match-sync/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"6IPGRFNXE0AE5FJS1YF2TD32S\""}
